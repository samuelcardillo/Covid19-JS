## Covid19.js

Still WIP. Focus is on making mutations "easier" to detect without big software. GUI will be built in order to allow better data viz. Initial code was trashed in order to rewrite properly a code suitable for GitHub publication.

## Usage

Give the name from the GenBank as an argument to `covid19.js` in order to automatically download and interpret it. 
You can then use `viewer.html` to look at the genome and `compare.html` to compare 2 downloaded genomes in order
to see possible mutations.

Example of starting `covid19.js` : 
`./covid19.js MN908947`

You can find the genomes on the NCBI website : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/

## To do :
- Enhance interface design
- Improve comparison system
